# Talent-Coach
Building Talent Management solutions that will hopefully be useful for employee friends and friends and acquaintances who are running SMEs. ðŸ˜Š

**Motivation**
After completing the webdev bootcamp, I realized I can actually start building things! And I had no code ideas before that I wish to build and share with others. This flows from my passion in Talent Management. But funny enough, the first user story I may include in this app will be - Should you resign? 

**Project Description**
The app should be helpful for team leaders and HRs in understanding the company/team pulse and help in improving communication before important decisions are made.
On the other hand, employees should be able to find the app useful when discerning, reflecting, and finding ways to communicate with their manager or with HR. 
I wish to use Ruby on Rails and am in the process of fleshing out the features. 

**Contributions**
Contributions are very much welcome! ðŸ˜Š
Bugs, suggestions, or code~
